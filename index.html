<a id="whats-this" class="anchor" href="#whats-this" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's This?</h3>

<p>Experiments with touch interaction systems in mobile games. Each of the interaction system should be very familiar to users, easy to understand and use. For that reason all of the interaction systems are implementing common touch-gestures and behaviors like Swipe, Pan, Tap or elastic scrolling with inertia. And on top of this I am exploring ways to navigate player in virtual space and help player interact with game objects.</p>

<a id="whats-that" class="anchor" href="#whats-that" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's That?</h3>

<p>Project is developed in Unity game engine using TouchScript and LeanTween open-source libraries. To open this Unity project file you need Unity 5.3.2 or higher.</p>

<a id="orthogonal-crossroad-navigation" class="anchor" href="#orthogonal-crossroad-navigation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Orthogonal "crossroad" navigation</h3>

<p>This system allow player move around virtual world in similar way as you know from panning through web page on your mobile device except you can move in both vertical AND horizontal ways.</p>

<p>Player can move along something like corridors connected to each other with "crossroad" nodes. Each of these nodes can be configured so crossroad acts like 4-way crossroad, 3-way crossroad, 2-way crossroad or dead end.</p>

<p>When player bumps to dead end in crossroad everything acts like elastic scrolling from iOS.</p>

<p>Direction can be changed only inside crossroads and user doesn't even have to lift his finger from touch screen.</p>

<p>This is ongoing project developed by Lukáš Lízal (<a href="https://github.com/lukaslizal" class="user-mention">@lukaslizal</a>). Motivation is to create intuitive touch controls. You can use my code for whatever you want. If using in commercial project please gimme summ credits.</p>
