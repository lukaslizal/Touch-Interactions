  "body": "### What's This?\r\nExperiments with touch interaction systems in mobile games. Each of the interaction system should be very familiar to users, easy to understand and use. For that reason all of the interaction systems are implementing common touch-gestures and behaviors like Swipe, Pan, Tap or elastic scrolling with inertia. And on top of this I am exploring ways to navigate player in virtual space and help player interact with game objects.\r\n\r\n### What's That?\r\nProject is developed in Unity game engine using TouchScript and LeanTween open-source libraries. To open this Unity project file you need Unity 5.3.2 or higher.\r\n\r\n### Orthogonal \"crossroad\" navigation\r\nThis system allows player to move around virtual world in similar way as you know from panning through web page on your mobile device except you can move in both vertical AND horizontal ways.\r\nPlayer can move along something like corridors connected to each other with \"crossroad\" nodes. Each of these nodes can be configured so crossroad acts like 4-way crossroad, 3-way crossroad, 2-way crossroad or dead end.\r\n\r\n![directionalScroll](https://github.com/lukaslizal/Touch-Interactions/blob/master/Gif/out1.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\nWhen player bumps to dead end in crossroad everything acts like elastic scrolling from iOS.\r\n\r\n![directionalScroll](https://github.com/lukaslizal/Touch-Interactions/blob/master/Gif/out4.gif?raw=true)\r\n![directionalScroll](https://github.com/lukaslizal/Touch-Interactions/blob/master/Gif/out3.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\nDirection can be changed only inside crossroads and user doesn't have to lift his finger. When user changes direction he is being pushed into the middle of the corridor.\r\n\r\n![directionalScroll](https://github.com/lukaslizal/Touch-Interactions/blob/master/Gif/out2.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Curved path navigation\r\nSimply dragging (with elasticity) any object with finger (e.g. camera) along editable curves.\r\n\r\n![directionalScroll](https://github.com/lukaslizal/Touch-Interactions/blob/master/Gif/kruh.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\nAttractors can be placed on curve to snap camera to desirable point.\r\n\r\n![directionalScroll](https://github.com/lukaslizal/Touch-Interactions/blob/master/Gif/attract.gif?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Directional swipe\r\nThis is currently work in progress.\r\n\r\n### Responsive game content\r\nThis is currently work in progress.\r\n\r\n### Interactive game content\r\nThis is currently work in progress.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nThis is ongoing project developed by Lukáš Lízal (@lukaslizal). Motivation is to create intuitive touch controls. You can use my code for whatever you want. If using in commercial project please gimme summ credits.",
